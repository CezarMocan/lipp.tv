Setup instructions

1. Clone the repository

2. *npm install*

3. *npm run dev* to run the development server locally

All other scripts can be found in *package.json*. 

P.S. The deploy scripts are currently hooked to an S3 instance under my personal account, but they currently only work on my machine (where I have my AWS account's private keys.)
